## Overview

The `improve` tool scans the PR code changes, and automatically generates meaningful suggestions for improving the PR code.
The tool can be triggered automatically every time a new PR is [opened](../usage-guide/automations_and_usage.md#github-app-automatic-tools-when-a-new-pr-is-opened), or it can be invoked manually by commenting on any PR:

```toml
/improve
```

## Example usage

### Manual triggering

Invoke the tool manually by commenting `/improve` on any PR. The code suggestions by default are presented as a single comment:

To edit [configurations](#configuration-options) related to the `improve` tool, use the following template:

```toml
/improve --pr_code_suggestions.some_config1=... --pr_code_suggestions.some_config2=...
```

For example, you can present suggestions with verified replacement ranges as committable code comments by running:

```toml
/improve --pr_code_suggestions.commitable_code_suggestions=true
```

Suggestions whose replacement ranges cannot be verified remain regular comments without an apply action.

If batch publication fails, `/improve` retries each suggestion individually. If every retry fails,
it reports a failure instead of silently removing the progress comment. With
`config.propagate_tool_errors=true`, the publication error is also raised to the caller.
Regular fallback comments and coverage notices are published before the error is reported.
When this fallback output succeeds, it is retained without an additional failure banner;
error propagation still follows `config.propagate_tool_errors`.
If any individual retry succeeds, the existing partial-recovery behavior is preserved.

### Automatic triggering

To run the `improve` automatically when a PR is opened, define in a [configuration file](../usage-guide/configuration_options.md#local-configuration-file):

```toml
[github_app]
pr_commands = [
    "/improve",
    ...
]

[pr_code_suggestions]
num_code_suggestions_per_chunk = ...
...
```

- The `pr_commands` lists commands that will be executed automatically when a PR is opened.
- The `[pr_code_suggestions]` section contains the configurations for the `improve` tool you want to edit (if any)

### Incremental suggestions

On Azure DevOps, run `/improve -i` to analyze only changes made after the latest code-suggestions pass. The first
incremental run analyzes the full pull request when no earlier suggestions comment exists. A later run with no new
changes exits without calling the model.

### Table vs Committable code comments

PR-Agent supports two modes for presenting code suggestions:

1) [Table](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/code_suggestions_as_comment_closed.png) mode

2) [Inline Committable](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/improve.png) code comments mode.

The table format offers several key advantages:

- **Reduced noise**: Creates a cleaner PR experience with less clutter
- **Quick overview and prioritization**: Enables quick review of one-liner summaries, impact levels, and easy prioritization
- **High-level suggestions**: High-level suggestions that aren't tied to specific code chunks are presented only in the table mode
- **Centralized tracking**: Shows suggestion implementation status in one place
- **IDE integration**: Allows applying suggestions directly in your IDE via the CLI tool

Table mode is the default of PR-Agent, and is recommended approach for most users due to these benefits.

![code_suggestions_as_comment_closed.png](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/code_suggestions_as_comment_closed.png){width=512}

Teams with specific preferences can enable committable code comments mode in their local configuration, or use [dual publishing mode](#dual-publishing-mode).

> `Note - due to platform limitations, Bitbucket cloud and server supports only committable code comments mode.`


## `Extra instructions` and `best practices`

The `improve` tool can be further customized by providing additional instructions and best practices to the AI model.

### Extra instructions

You can use the `extra_instructions` configuration option to give the AI model additional instructions for the `improve` tool.
Be specific, clear, and concise in the instructions. With extra instructions, you are the prompter.

Examples for possible instructions:

```toml
[pr_code_suggestions]
extra_instructions="""\
(1) Answer in Japanese
(2) Don't suggest to add try-except block
(3) Ignore changes in toml files
...
"""
```

Use triple quotes to write multi-line instructions. Use bullet points or numbers to make the instructions more readable.

### Best practices

`Platforms supported: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket`

!!! warning "Open-source PR-Agent"

    Automatic loading of `best_practices.md` is a Qodo Merge feature and is not available in the open-source
    PR-Agent package. In the open-source package, add the file to `config.repo_context_files` instead:

    ```toml
    [config]
    repo_context_files = ["AGENTS.md", "best_practices.md"]
    ```

    This fallback supports GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps. Repository context files are read
    from the default branch by default and are limited by
    `config.repo_context_max_lines` (500 lines by default). Set `config.repo_context_from_default_branch = false`
    to read them from the pull request's target branch instead. Providers without repository file fetching log a
    warning and skip this context.

Qodo Merge supports both simple and hierarchical best practices configurations to provide guidance to the AI model for generating relevant code suggestions.

???- tip "Writing effective best practices files"

    The following guidelines apply to all best practices files:

    - Write clearly and concisely
    - Include brief code examples when helpful with before/after patterns
    - Focus on project-specific guidelines that will result in relevant suggestions you actually want to get
    - Keep each file relatively short, under 800 lines, since:
        - AI models may not process effectively very long documents
        - Long files tend to contain generic guidelines already known to AI
        - Maximum multiple file accumulated content is limited to 2000 lines.
    - Use pattern-based structure rather than simple bullet points for better clarity

???- tip "Example of a best practices file"

    Pattern 1: Add proper error handling with try-except blocks around external function calls.

    Example code before:

    ```python
    # Some code that might raise an exception
    return process_pr_data(data)
    ```

    Example code after:

    ```python
    try:
        # Some code that might raise an exception
        return process_pr_data(data)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("Failed to process request", extra={"error": e})
    ```

    Pattern 2: Add defensive null/empty checks before accessing object properties or performing operations on potentially null variables to prevent runtime errors.

    Example code before:

    ```python
    def get_pr_code(pr_data):
        if "changed_code" in pr_data:
            return pr_data.get("changed_code", "")
        return ""
    ```

    Example code after:

    ```python
    def get_pr_code(pr_data):
        if pr_data is None:
            return ""
        if "changed_code" in pr_data:
            return pr_data.get("changed_code", "")
        return ""
    ```

#### Local best practices in Qodo Merge

For basic usage, create a `best_practices.md` file in your repository's root directory containing a list of best practices, coding standards, and guidelines specific to your repository.

The AI model will use this `best_practices.md` file as a reference, and in case the PR code violates any of the guidelines, it will create additional suggestions, with a dedicated label: `Organization best practice`.

### Combining 'extra instructions' and 'best practices'

The `extra instructions` configuration is more related to the `improve` tool prompt. It can be used, for example, to avoid specific suggestions ("Don't suggest to add try-except block", "Ignore changes in toml files", ...) or to emphasize specific aspects or formats ("Answer in Japanese", "Give only short suggestions", ...)

In contrast, the `best_practices.md` file is a general guideline for the way code should be written in the repo.

Using a combination of both can help the AI model to provide relevant and tailored suggestions.

## Usage Tips

### Implementing the proposed code suggestions

Each generated suggestion consists of three key elements:

1. A single-line summary of the proposed change
2. An expandable section containing a comprehensive description of the suggestion
3. A diff snippet showing the recommended code modification (before and after)

We advise users to apply critical analysis and judgment when implementing the proposed suggestions.
In addition to mistakes (which may happen, but are rare), sometimes the presented code modification may serve more as an _illustrative example_ than a directly applicable solution.
In such cases, we recommend prioritizing the suggestion's detailed description, using the diff snippet primarily as a supporting reference.

### Dual publishing mode

Our recommended approach for presenting code suggestions is through a [table](./improve.md#overview) (`--pr_code_suggestions.commitable_code_suggestions=false`).
This method significantly reduces the PR footprint and allows for quick and easy digestion of multiple suggestions.

We also offer a complementary **dual publishing mode**. When enabled, suggestions exceeding a certain score threshold are not only displayed in the table, but also presented as committable PR comments.
This mode helps highlight suggestions deemed more critical.

To activate dual publishing mode, use the following setting:

```toml
[pr_code_suggestions]
dual_publishing_score_threshold = x
```

Where x represents the minimum score threshold (>=) for suggestions to be presented as committable PR comments in addition to the table. Default is -1 (disabled).

### Persistent inline comments

By default, PR-Agent re-posts identical inline code comments on every run, which clutters the discussion, particularly on GitLab. The persistent inline comments feature prevents this by skipping the re-posting of comments that are already present from an earlier run. This is achieved by embedding a hidden HTML-comment marker with a short fingerprint in each posted comment, allowing PR-Agent to scan existing comment bodies on later runs to identify and skip duplicates.

Two fingerprints are used and matched with OR logic: one over the comment text (file, line, normalised text) and one
over the proposed code block when present. This approach catches a re-emitted finding even when the model rephrases
the prose or slightly changes the code. The feature is opt-in and off by default, and is implemented for the GitHub,
GitLab, and Azure DevOps providers.

Azure DevOps fingerprints include the complete line range and normalized finding text, so the same issue at another
location remains eligible. Active suggestion threads are marked as fixed when their proposed code exactly matches the
current file. Existing terminal statuses are preserved.

Azure DevOps also includes earlier suggestion threads and their replies as context on the next suggestions pass. A
regular `/improve` reviews the full current pull request while avoiding issues that were already raised, addressed,
rejected, or deferred. Use `/improve -i` to review only changes since the previous suggestions pass.

Duplicate suppression and applied-suggestion reconciliation require `persistent_inline_comments`. Discussion context
and threaded questions remain available without it.

To enable it, use the following setting:

```toml
[config]
persistent_inline_comments = true
```

### Batch-publishing committable suggestions on GitLab

`Platforms supported: GitLab`

By default, when `commitable_code_suggestions` is enabled, GitLab posts each suggestion as its own live discussion as soon as it's created - which means a separate notification (and email, if configured) per suggestion. To instead queue all suggestions and publish them together in a single batch, similar to using "start a review" in the GitLab UI, enable:

```toml
[gitlab]
publish_code_suggestions_as_review = true
```

Suggestions are posted as GitLab draft notes (visible only to PR-Agent's user until published) and published together with a single API call once all suggestions have been queued. The suggestions remain fully committable either way - this setting only changes how they're delivered. The publish call is only made if at least one suggestion was actually queued, so a run with nothing to post won't accidentally publish unrelated drafts already pending on the MR.

### Self-review

`Platforms supported: GitHub, GitLab`

If you set in a configuration file:

```toml
[pr_code_suggestions]
demand_code_suggestions_self_review = true
```

The `improve` tool will add a checkbox below the suggestions, prompting user to acknowledge that they have reviewed the suggestions.
You can set the content of the checkbox text via:

```toml
[pr_code_suggestions]
code_suggestions_self_review_text = "... (your text here) ..."
```

![self_review_1](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/self_review_1.png){width=512}

!!! note "The checkbox is a visual marker only"

    PR-Agent renders the checkbox, but does not react to it being ticked. Nothing is folded, and no approval is added, when the PR author clicks it.

### How many code suggestions are generated?

PR-Agent uses a dynamic strategy to generate code suggestions based on the size of the pull request (PR). Here's how it works:

#### 1. Chunking large PRs

- PR-Agent divides large PRs into 'chunks'.
- Each chunk contains up to `config.max_model_tokens` tokens (default: 32,000).

#### 2. Generating suggestions

- For each chunk, PR-Agent generates up to `pr_code_suggestions.num_code_suggestions_per_chunk` suggestions (default: 3).
- To bound output from large or chunked PRs, set `pr_code_suggestions.max_suggestions_per_file` to a positive integer.
  After all chunks are merged, the highest-scored suggestions are retained per file; ties keep their original order.
  The default value `0` disables this cap.

This approach has two main benefits:

- Scalability: The number of suggestions scales with the PR size, rather than being fixed.
- Quality: By processing smaller chunks, the AI can maintain higher quality suggestions, as larger contexts tend to decrease AI performance.

Note: Chunking is primarily relevant for large PRs. For most PRs (up to 600 lines of code), PR-Agent will be able to process the entire code in a single call.

## Configuration options

The descriptions below explain each option's behavior. See the relevant sections in
[`configuration.toml`](https://github.com/the-pr-agent/pr-agent/blob/main/pr_agent/settings/configuration.toml)
for the authoritative default values.

      <tr>
        <td><b>suggestions_heading</b></td>
        <td>
          Visible base heading for summary-table improve comments, without the Markdown prefix.
          For example, <code>suggestions_heading = "Guideline Improvement Suggestions"</code> renders
          <code>## Guideline Improvement Suggestions ✨</code>. On GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps,
          changing this value updates the same persistent suggestions comment; it does not create a separate
          suggestions channel. LocalGit uses the same visible heading in <code>improve.md</code>, without a
          hidden identity marker. The setting does not affect committable inline suggestions.

## Understanding AI Code Suggestions

- **AI Limitations:** AI models for code are getting better and better, but they are not flawless. Not all the suggestions will be perfect, and a user should not accept all of them automatically. Critical reading and judgment are required. Mistakes of the AI are rare but can happen, and it is usually quite easy for a human to spot them.
- **Purpose of Suggestions:**
    - **Self-reflection:** The suggestions aim to enable developers to _self-reflect_ and improve their pull requests. This process can help to identify blind spots, uncover missed edge cases, and enhance code readability and coherency. Even when a specific code suggestion isn't suitable, the underlying issue it highlights often reveals something important that might deserve attention.
    - **Bug detection:** The suggestions also alert on any _critical bugs_ that may have been identified during the analysis. This provides an additional safety net to catch potential issues before they make it into production. It's perfectly acceptable to implement only the suggestions you find valuable for your specific context.
- **Hierarchy:** Presenting the suggestions in a structured hierarchical table enables the user to _quickly_ understand them, and to decide which ones are relevant and which are not.
- **Customization:** To guide the model to suggestions that are more relevant to the specific needs of your project, we recommend using the [`extra_instructions`](./improve.md#extra-instructions-and-best-practices) and [`best practices`](./improve.md#best-practices) fields.
- **Model Selection:** For specific programming languages or use cases, some models may perform better than others.
